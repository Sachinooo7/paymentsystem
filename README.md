Implementation of error handling funtions in transaction process.

in this we are going to use error handling functions like revert(),assert(),require().
require function first  checked the condition than if false throw an error and  statement which is user defined.
revert in  this first we check the condition using if else than .if false revert statement executes and execution start from initial state.
assert is also same like require but we cannot add parameter in this.
